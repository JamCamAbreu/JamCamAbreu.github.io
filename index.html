planned and implemented for my current employer at the Club for Boys, Rapid City, SD.
Using the local network, information about student learning (such as homework or pages
read) is entered into the database. Information about student learning based on a wide
variety of factors such as age, school, and more are queried with student work. Queried
data is used for club donors and community interest in the studentsâ€™ progress. Please ask for
more information.
